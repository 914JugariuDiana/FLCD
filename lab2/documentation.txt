Created a hash table with:
- a table (a list with lists) and a given size, if multiple elements hash to the same osition there will be added to a list with elements that hash to the same position
- a hash function that adds the ascii code of the characters and than does modulo on them
- a add function, that adds the key to the table, returns the position of the element
- a contains function, returns true if the value already is in the table, false otherwise
- a getPos function, returns a pair containing the index of the position in the list and the index of the position in the second list
